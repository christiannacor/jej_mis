# jejMIS

jejMIS is a Simple Management Information System
from [MINI](http://www.php-mini.com) and [PHP-LOGIN](http://www.php-login.net/) projects reversed and modified for my CAPSTONE project.

## Features? 

- Powered with [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) Pattern. So, it's understandable for future developers.
- Functional login / logout / ~~change~~ / ~~register~~ actions [1]
- Pulled some functions and classes from third-party sources
- "Beautiful" clean URLs
- CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily
- Tries to follow PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- Uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- Better error and exception handling
- More secured (Can't touch this??)
- More compatible for cross-platforms!
- Mobile-friendly!
- Internet Explorer is no longer required for this system, so choose Firefox, Opera or Chrome! [2]
- Uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a complex, shitty frameworks such as CodeIgniter, CakePHP etc.
- Can use SHA1, MD5 and PHP (v.5.3+) Encryption Hashes
- and so much more!

NOTES:
[1] This project is based on the scopes and limitations of my course projects. If you want to include change and register actions, you can modify or add codes from php-login repository.
[2] Internet Explorer already ended the lifespan/support from Microsoft which is it will occur security conflicts.

## Requirements
#### GEEK ALERT: Better to use web server packages such as XAMPP (Windows/Linux) and MAMPP (Mac OS X)!

- Apache Server 2.4.*+
- PHP 5.3.7+
- MySQL 5.6.*+
- 'mod_rewrite' Must be Activated
- Browser that supports CSS3 and HTML5 **(EXCEPT INTERNET EXPLORER!)**. Check out this [reference](http://caniuse.com/) to know how.
- Coming Soon: Mobile Version!
- Your database

## REMINDER / DISCLAIMER

This system is only for educational purposes. You can obtain it but there will be no database on this repo.
So, you should have already one.
